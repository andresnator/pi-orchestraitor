# Technical PRD

## Activation Contract

Use this skill to build a full technical PRD through an interactive, phase-by-phase conversation. A full PRD is appropriate when the work needs strong alignment, explicit tradeoffs, measurable outcomes, quality/security coverage, dependency mapping, risks, acceptance criteria, and traceability from goals to delivery.

Always read `assets/prd-template.md` at the start of the session and use it as the final document skeleton.

## Hard Rules

- Work one phase at a time; do not dump the whole template as a questionnaire.
- Ask one focused question at a time where possible.
- Ask open-ended questions directly in normal chat; use Pi's available UI choice mechanism for closed choices when available; otherwise ask in chat.
- Add `Recommendation: ...` only when it helps the user respond. Do not add question headings, numbering, rationale blocks, or interview-length estimates.
- At a phase boundary, give a brief summary of accumulated decisions and open items before asking the next phase's first question. Do not summarize after every question.
- Validate the current phase before advancing.
- Challenge vague, unverifiable, or contradictory requirements with a concrete reason.
- Do not invent unknown facts; preserve uncertainty as open questions, assumptions, or explicit `TBD` items.
- Allow `N/A` only with a short justification, and push back when skipping would hide material risk.
- Keep the document rigorous but usable; avoid decorative tables that add no decision value.
- Maintain traceability across problem, goals, requirements, acceptance criteria, metrics, risks, and delivery.
- Use the reference template for the final artifact.
- Ask where to save the PRD after presenting the final draft; suggest `PRD-{product-name}-v{version}.md` if the user wants a default.

## Conversation Format

Use this minimal shape for open interview questions:

```markdown
[Direct question]

Recommendation: [short recommended/default answer when useful]
```

Omit the recommendation line when it adds no value.

## Decision Gates

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Missing intent or product area | Ask what product, feature, or decision the PRD should cover. |
| Problem is vague or solution-first | Ask who has the problem, what hurts today, and why now. |
| Acceptance criteria are missing | Stop advancement for functional requirements until each must-have has verifiable criteria. |
| Metrics are not measurable | Ask for target, baseline if known, measurement method, or mark the metric as `TBD` with an owner. |
| Security, compliance, data, or dependency section is marked `N/A` | Require a short justification and record it in the PRD. |
| Existing PRD is being resumed | Ask for the path, read it, identify complete/incomplete sections, summarize state, then continue from the first incomplete phase. |
| User cannot answer a detail yet | Capture an open question with owner/due date if known; continue only if the missing detail does not block validation. |

## Execution Steps

1. Read `assets/prd-template.md`.
2. Establish document metadata: product/feature name, version, author, date, status.
3. Phase 1, Overview: capture problem, context, scope, out-of-scope, stakeholders, and assumptions.
4. Phase 2, Goals and Success: capture goals, non-goals, measurable metrics, and how success will be checked.
5. Phase 3, Users and Use Cases: capture user groups, core scenarios, edge/error paths, and use-case priorities.
6. Phase 4, Requirements and Acceptance: capture functional requirements, priorities, and acceptance criteria.
7. Phase 5, Quality, Security, and Dependencies: capture relevant non-functional requirements, data/security/compliance needs, dependencies, integrations, and fallback expectations.
8. Phase 6, Architecture and Interfaces: capture architecture, data flow, API/interface contracts, and ownership only where relevant to build or review decisions.
9. Phase 7, Risks and Open Questions: capture risks, mitigations, assumptions, unresolved questions, owners, and due dates where known.
10. Phase 8, Delivery and Traceability: capture MVP/release slices, milestones, rollout/rollback needs, and trace requirements back to goals and acceptance criteria.
11. Generate the final PRD from the template, replacing placeholders with collected content and marking justified gaps clearly.
12. Present the final PRD for review and ask where to save it.

## Validation Rules

- The problem statement names affected users and current pain.
- Scope includes both in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries.
- Each goal has at least one measurable or explicitly `TBD` success signal.
- Each must-have functional requirement has acceptance criteria.
- Quality requirements use numbers where numbers matter.
- Security and compliance coverage matches the data and user access model.
- External dependencies include impact and fallback or degradation behavior.
- Risks are connected to requirements, architecture, dependencies, delivery, or unknowns.
- Delivery plan accounts for must-have requirements and known blockers.
- Open questions are visible rather than hidden in prose.

## Output Contract

Return the complete PRD document in Markdown using `assets/prd-template.md`.

After the draft, include a short final review request covering:

- Confirmed sections.
- Remaining `TBD`, assumptions, and open questions.
- Suggested save path or a question asking where to save the file.
