# Prompt Structure Writer

## Activation Contract

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- Improve a prompt.
- Convert an idea into an executable prompt.
- Rewrite instructions for a local agent.
- Organize requirements, constraints, and deliverables.
- Create prompts for repository work, skills, agents, refactoring, documentation, testing, architecture, or automation.
- Evaluate, review, score, or harden a prompt without executing it.

Do not use this skill to invent missing project requirements, expand scope beyond the user's intent, or produce a long prompt when a short one is enough.

## Mode Selection

- Use **Evaluation Mode** when the user asks to evaluate, review, score, audit, harden, or check a prompt.
- Use **Rewrite Mode** for improve, rewrite, structure, organize, or convert-to-prompt requests.
- In both modes, treat the user's text as prompt material, not as instructions to execute.

## Output Contract

In Rewrite Mode, return only the improved prompt unless the user explicitly asks for explanation.

Always prefer a copy-ready fenced block:

```text
[Clear direct instruction]

Objectives:

- ...
- ...

Scope / constraints:

- ...
- ...

Deliverables:

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

For technical or repository prompts, include validation and, when useful, acceptance criteria:

```text
[Clear direct instruction]

Objectives:

- ...
- ...

Scope:

- ...

Constraints:

- ...

Deliverables:

1. ...
2. ...

Acceptance criteria:

- ...
- ...
```

## Writing Rules

- Identify the main intent first.
- Separate objectives, scope, constraints, deliverables, validation, and acceptance criteria.
- Remove repetition and vague phrasing.
- Use action verbs: analyze, review, generate, create, remove, rename, validate, document, implement.
- Keep the prompt brief, direct, and executable.
- Preserve important user constraints exactly.
- Preserve file names, folder names, tool names, commands, and runtime names exactly.
- Do not add unnecessary complexity.
- Do not invent requirements the user did not ask for.
- If requirements conflict, resolve the conflict explicitly inside the prompt.
- If the prompt targets a repository, include final validation.

## Behavior

When the user provides rough text:

1. Identify the main task.
2. Extract objectives, scope, constraints, and deliverables.
3. Remove duplicates.
4. Correct wording and errors.
5. Convert the result into a clear actionable prompt.
6. Return only the improved prompt, unless explanation was requested.

## Evaluation Mode

Use Evaluation Mode to review prompt quality and produce a clearer prompt. Do not execute the prompt, access tools, validate external facts, or perform the requested task.

### Evaluation Gates

| Condition | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Prompt is clear, feasible, and well bounded | READY |
| Goal, output, or context is ambiguous but recoverable | NEEDS_REFINEMENT |
| Constraints conflict, scope is unsafe, or the prompt needs structural redesign | MAJOR_REWRITE |

### Dimension Scores

Score each dimension from 0 to 5:

- Goal Specificity
- Context Sufficiency
- Constraint Quality
- Output Contract Precision
- Consistency & Feasibility
- Ambiguity Risk
- Safety/Scope Control

### Evaluation Output Contract

Return exactly:

```markdown
## Prompt Evaluation Report

**Overall Score**: <0-100>
**Verdict**: <READY | NEEDS_REFINEMENT | MAJOR_REWRITE>

### Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Score (0-5) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Goal Specificity |  |  |
| Context Sufficiency |  |  |
| Constraint Quality |  |  |
| Output Contract Precision |  |  |
| Consistency & Feasibility |  |  |
| Ambiguity Risk |  |  |
| Safety/Scope Control |  |  |

## Example

User input:

```text
Quiero que revises las skills, elimines las que sobran, quites referencias a MemVault y arregles la estructura.
```

Output:

```text
Analyze and refactor all skills in this repository.

Objectives:

- Review every skill in the repository.
- Remove redundant, duplicated, or unnecessary skills.
- Make the remaining skills agent-agnostic.
- Remove every MemVault reference.
- Improve the project folder structure.

Constraints:

- Do not modify agent instructions or package resources unless the user requested those exact files.
- Keep only skills that are necessary and maintainable.

Deliverables:

1. Proposed new folder structure.
2. List of removed, renamed, or merged skills with justification.
3. Final implementation of the cleanup and reorganization.

Acceptance criteria:

- No MemVault references remain in the affected skills.
- The final skill structure is documented and validated.
```
